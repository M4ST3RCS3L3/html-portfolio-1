<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
 My name is David Cseledi.
 I'm 21 years old. I like dinosaurs, cars, and guns, you know the man stuffs. 
 I have a litle sister who I like a lot.
 I have a dog. He's a 48kg big boy (kangal-germanshepherd mix). He's my best friend and I really love him.
 I have Diabetes (type 1). When I was younger, I hated myself because of this but nowadays I accepted it, and I'm trying to be healthy as far as possible.
 I like to learn about thing that I have intrest in, go to cruise with my car, go for a walk with my dog, and fun in anyway. </p>

 When I was done with the primary school I wanted to be a Doctor (because of my disease), but in Hungary we don't have very good healthcare and from this it can be concluded that we have bad schools to learn.
 That's a sad thing but true. 
 After 2 years in school I found out that I don't wanna be a doctor anymore, but I finished my school anyway to have an nursing profession.
 After I finished the school I wasn't work in my profession a single minute.
 I'm started to question myself: "What is the profession that not only pays you good but helps you at your home?"
 And my dad advice was that I should learn eletricity.
 I thought it was a good idea so I'm started to learn this profession.
 After 1 year I finished my school and sterted to work in my profession.
 I had a good time in my workplace but I was short of payment and I quited.
 After that I worked in a dogshelter(where my dog, TÃ¶ki from).
 I really liked it but it was really tiring and and my sellery was low here too so after 6 months I needed to quit from here too.
 After that my former schoolmate invited me to an electrician company where he having a better sellery than my last workplaces.
 So I accepted the invite and right now I'm working here and apart from one or two things, I find it a very good place.

 My plan to the future is to have a company and to have a sellery that pays me at least 10.000$/month by helping other people by making them happy or help them to be rich too.
 I don't care how am I will be able to have this dream but I know that one day I will have it.
 That's why I'm started to learn web development.
 I think this profession will help me to catch my dream.
