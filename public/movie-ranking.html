<h1>The best movies according to David</h1>
<h2>My best 3 movies from all-time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Fast and furious 2,3</h3>
<p>I like these movies beacuse the story is only about cars and racing, not some sci-fi boring nowadays movie.</p>
<h3>Jurassic Park 1-3</h3>
<p>When I was a litle boy I was stunned by these movies because the dinosaurs looked really cool and the storyline was good enough for me.</p>
<h3>The wolf of the Wolf street</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite movies since I grew up and the money is started to be interesting for me. The actors doing a really good job and the story line is very awesome too. You can love or hate the characters, and this is a good point for me. </p>
